# CSS Grid Playground

It's a little web app that I've made while I was learning CSS Grid and bored at work. I thought that it would be nice to have something interactive to try and see what Grid can reeally do, so here it is - Grid Playground.

Right now you can:
- add or delete grid items, 
- change the number of rows and column, 
- change grid container width and height, 
- change the column and row gap,
- change grid-auto-flow.

But there will be more options in the next releases.

If you need help, you can clikc the "Feeling Lost?" button which will open a modal box with all the basic grid properties used in this app.

DICSLAIMER: There are no official definitions here - use MDN to see those.

Made entirely with HTML, CSS (Sass) and ES6 JavaScript.
